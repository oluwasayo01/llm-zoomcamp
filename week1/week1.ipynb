      "3. **Course Type:** Online courses might have more flexible start times than traditional in-person courses. Some online platforms offer self-paced courses that you can start at any time.\n",

      "4. **Instructor Policies:** Contact the instructor or course coordinator to see if they allow late enrollments. They can provide insights into any catch-up work that may be required.\n",

      "If it's too late for the current session, you might want to wait for the next offering or see if there are other similar courses available.\n"
